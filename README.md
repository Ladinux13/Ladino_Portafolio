# Interactive Dashboards

This branch showcases the development of an interactive dashboard for visualizing institutional supervision metrics, along with the individual charts that power it.

The dashboard was built using **Python**, **Streamlit**, and visualization libraries such as Plotly and Matplotlib to ensure a clear and accessible interface for non-technical users.
